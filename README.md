## Overview

![screenshot](./img_src/screenshot.png)

Spyder is a Python development environment with a lot of features:

* **Editor**

    Multi-language editor with function/class browser, code analysis
    features (pyflakes and pylint are currently supported), code
    completion, horizontal and vertical splitting, and goto definition.

* **Interactive console**

    Python or IPython consoles with workspace and debugging support to
    instantly evaluate the code written in the Editor. It also comes
    with Matplotlib figures integration.

* **Documentation viewer**

    Show documentation for any class or function call made either in the
    Editor or a Console.

* **Variable explorer**

    Explore variables created during the execution of a file. Editing
    them is also possible with several GUI based editors, like a
    dictionary and Numpy array ones.

* **Find in files**

    Supporting regular expressions and mercurial repositories

* **File explorer**

* **History log**

Spyder may also be used as a PyQt5/PyQt4 extension library (module
`spyder`). For example, the Python interactive shell widget used in
Spyder may be embedded in your own PyQt5/PyQt4 application.

## Installation

This section explains how to install the latest stable release of
Spyder. If you prefer testing the development version, please use
the `bootstrap` script (see next section).

### The Easy/Recommended Way: Anaconda

The easiest way to install Spyder for any of our platform, and
the way we recommend to avoid unexpected issues we aren't able to
help you with, is to download it as part of the
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution, and keep
it updated and install other packages with the `conda` package
and environment manager.

If in doubt, you should install via this method; it generally has the
least likelihood of potential pitfalls for non-experts, and we may be
able to provide limited assistance if you do run into trouble.

### The Harder Way: Alternative Distributions

**Important Note:** While we offer alternative options for users who
desire them, if you encounter installation issues you are unable to
solve on your own, we recommend you use Anaconda instead, as we are
generally unable to offer individual assistance for problems specific
to installing via these alternative distributions.

** Windows **

Spyder is included in these other scientific Python distributions:

* [WinPython](https://winpython.github.io/)
* [Python(x,y)](http://python-xy.github.io)

** macOS **

Spyder can be obtained through through
[MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/).

** GNU/Linux **

* You can often get Spyder through your distribution's package
manager (i.e. `apt-get`, `yum`, etc), or install from source
(see below).

### The Expert/Cross-platform Way: Installing from source with pip

**Warning:** While this installation method is a viable option for
experienced users, installing Spyder (and other SciPy stack packages)
with `pip` can encounter a number of tricky issues. While you are welcome
to try this on your own if you're an expert, we are unable to help if you
do run into problems, except to recommend using Anaconda instead.

You can also install Spyder with the `pip` package manager, which comes by
default with most Python installations. To do so, you need to use the command:
```
    pip install spyder
```
To upgrade Spyder to its latest version, if it was installed before, you need
to run:
```
    pip install --upgrade spyder
```

**Important note**: This does not install the graphical Python libraries (i.e.
PyQt5 or PyQt4) that Spyder depends on. Those have to be installed separately
after installing Python.


For more details on supported platforms, please refer to our
[installation instructions](http://pythonhosted.org/spyder/installation.html).


## Running from source

The fastest way to run Spyder is to run form source, hosted on the
[Spyder github repo](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder).
You may want to do this for fixing bugs in Spyder, adding new
features, learning how Spyder works or just getting a taste of it.
Make sure to copy the path listed under the "Clone or Download" button there,
or just use https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder.git .

If using `conda` (strongly recommended), run the following from
the command line (the Anaconda Prompt, if on Windows):
```
conda install spyder
conda remove spyder
git clone PATH_FROM_SPYDER_REPO
cd DIR_YOU_CLONED_IT_TO
python bootstrap.py
```

Alternatively, you can install PyQt5 (or PyQt4) separately and use `pip`
to install the *runtime dependencies* discussed below, but this is
for experts only and is not recommend, so you'll have to solve any
problems on your own. See the
[installation instructions](http://pythonhosted.org/spyder/installation.html)
for more detail.


## Dependencies

**Important note**: Most if not all the dependencies listed below come
with *Anaconda*, *WinPython* and *Python(x,y)*, so you don't need to install
them separately when installing one of these Scientific Python
distributions.

### Build dependencies

When installing Spyder from its source package, the only requirement is to have
a Python version greater than 2.7 (Python 3.2 is not supported anymore).

### Runtime dependencies

* **Python** 2.7 or 3.3+
* **PyQt5** 5.2+ or **PyQt4** 4.6+: PyQt5 is recommended.
* **qtconsole** 4.2.0+: Enhanced Python interpreter.
* **Rope** 0.9.4+ and **Jedi** 0.9.0+: Editor code completion, calltips
  and go-to-definition.
* **Pyflakes**: Real-time code analysis.
* **Sphinx**: Rich text mode for the Help pane.
* **Pygments** 2.0+: Syntax highlighting for all file types it supports.
* **Pylint**: Static code analysis.
* **Pycodestyle**: Style analysis.
* **Psutil**: CPU and memory usage on the status bar.
* **Nbconvert**: Manipulation of notebooks in the Editor.
* **Qtawesome** 0.4.1+: To have an icon theme based on FontAwesome.
* **Pickleshare**: Show import completions on the Python consoles.
* **PyZMQ**: Run introspection services asynchronously.
* **QtPy** 1.2.0+: Abstracion layer for Python Qt bindings so that Spyder can run on PyQt4
  and PyQt5.
* **Chardet**: Character encoding auto-detection in Python.
* **Numpydoc**: Used by Jedi to get return types for functions with Numpydoc docstrings.
* **Cloudpickle**: Serialize variables in the IPython kernel to send them to Spyder.

### Optional dependencies

* **Matplotlib**: 2D/3D plotting in the Python and IPython consoles.
* **Pandas**: View and edit DataFrames and Series in the Variable Explorer.
* **Numpy**: View and edit two or three dimensional arrays in the Variable Explorer.
* **SymPy**: Symbolic mathematics in the IPython console.
* **SciPy**: Import Matlab workspace files in the Variable Explorer.
* **Cython**: Run Cython files in the IPython console.
