*DRAFT: this page has not been completely updated from Spyder v1.1 to v2.0*

Spyder is a Python development environment with the following features:

:doc:`editor`:
    Source editor with outline explorer (functions, classes, ...), code
    analysis (pyflakes and pylint are currently supported), code completion, 
    go-to-definition, calltips, cursor position history, horizontal/vertical 
    splitting, etc.
    
:doc:`inspector`:
    Automatically show documentation (if available, or source code otherwise) 
    for any class instantiation or function call made in a Python console or 
    in the source editor
    
:doc:`onlinehelp`:
    Open an internal web browser to explore dynamically-generated Python 
    documentation on installed module, including your own modules (this feature 
    is using a pydoc server)
    
:doc:`console`:
    Run Python scripts or open as many Python/IPython interpreters or terminals 
    as you need.
    Python/IPython interpreters: variable explorer (list supported variables 
    with GUI based editors: dictionary editor, array editor, ...), debugging 
    with `pdb`, code completion, calltips, etc.
    
:doc:`explorer`:
    File/directory explorer
    
Find in files feature:
    Supporting regular expressions and mercurial repositories
    
:doc:`historylog`

Spyder may also be used as a PyQt4 extension library (module 'spyderlib').
For example, the Python interactive shell widget used in Spyder may be
embedded in your own PyQt4 application.
