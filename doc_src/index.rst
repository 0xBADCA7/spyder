Welcome to Spyder's documentation!
==================================

Spyder is a Python development environment with advanced editing, interactive 
testing, debugging and introspection features. It is especially recommended for 
scientific computing thanks to `NumPy` (linear algebra), `SciPy` (signal and 
image processing), `matplotlib` (interactive 2D/3D plotting), MayaVi's 
`mlab` (interactive 3D visualization) and -of course- `IPython` support.

Spyder may also be used as a library providing powerful console-related PyQt4 
widgets.
