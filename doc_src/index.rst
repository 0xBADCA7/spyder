Welcome to Spyder's documentation!
==================================

Spyder is a Python development environment with advanced editing, interactive 
testing, debugging and introspection features. It is especially recommended for 
scientific computing thanks to `NumPy`, `SciPy` and `matplotlib` integration.

Spyder may also be used as an extension library providing powerful 
console-related PyQt4 widgets.
