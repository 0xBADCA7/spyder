"""External Python Shell's input hook manager

As of today, only PyQt4 and Tkinter are supported this way.

This workaround is intended to be used on Windows platforms only.
On Windows platforms, no real console is attached to a subprocess Python 
interpreter opened by Spyder's console. As a consequence, some basic Windows 
functions won't work: msvcrt.getch, msvcrt.kbhit, ...
This is the reason why the original PyQt's input hook does not work within 
Spyder's console. PyQt's input hook uses msvcrt's kbhit function to check if 
keyboard input is waiting to be processed: this function always returns False 
if there is no console attached to the process.

Spyder's input hook uses a non-blocking readline mechanism to check if entered 
text is available, and in the meantime it processes Qt events.

see `generic_inputhook` docstring for more details."""
