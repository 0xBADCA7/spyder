----

== Version 2.1.6 ==

=== Bug fixes (since v2.1.5) ===

  * Critical bug on certain Windows platforms (not sure yet if it's related to a particular version of PyQt or something else): all plugins (dockwidgets) were shown detached (or hidden) from the mainwindow at startup (this is related to the attempt fixing Issue 880)

----

== Version 2.1.5 ==

=== Bug fixes (since v2.1.4) ===

  * [This bugfix was removed on v2.1.6 due to side-effects](Fixed on Windows platforms with !PyQt v4.8+ only) Detached dockwidgets (Console, ...) were not painted after restarting Spyder
  * Editor/Outline-bugfix: duplicate entries were shown when the editor was synchronizing file contents with disk
  * File/Project explorer:
    * Fixed regression regarding Issue 740 (fixed in v2.1.0, re-introduced in v2.1.2): couldn't open files with non-ascii characters in their names
    * SCM support: commit/log actions were not working when right-clicking on a file instead of a folder
  * Console:
    * Monitor/Introspection: fixed socket communication issue due to a !MemoryError -- This error was mixing communication messages, causing various problems described in Issue 857 and Issue 858. This bug was reported by ruoyu0088, who also tried (and succeeded) to fix it and suggested a workaround which is implemented in this release
    * Fix critical console hang on OS X when using the "Run selection or current block feature" (see Issue 502)
    * Apply the right scheme color to the !IPython console when there weren't any options provided by the user or when the only option was "-colors LightBG"
  * Windows platforms:
    * "Preferences" dialog was not shown if account username contained non-ASCII characters
  * Object Inspector:
    * Show signatures for docstrings sent from the Editor (see Issue 690)

=== Other changes (since v2.1.4) ===

  * Debugging: when a non-empty SPYDER_DEBUG environment variable exists, Spyder switch to debug mode (log files are created in user's home directory and debug prints are available in the terminal)
  * Variable explorer/Dictionary editor: added option to plot histogram from a 1-D array
  * Console:
    * standard Python interpreter is now a real Python interactive session: the older implementation was running a startup script and tried to emulate a standard Python interactive session (changing attributes like __name__, running the PYTHONSTARTUP script, etc.). But this implementation was not close enough to the standard Python interactive session, i.e. when you execute `python` outside Spyder, without any argument. A recent bug report confirmed this: the PYTHONSTARTUP script was executed but not exactly the same way as it is outside Spyder: for example, doing `from __future__ import division` in the startup script had no effect whereas it did outside Spyder.
    * when running a standard Python interpreter, instead of running the startup script (spyderlib/widgets/externalshell/startup.py), the shell widget (ExternalPythonShell) simply runs the python executable with -u -i options, that's all. So now, the PYTHONSTARTUP script is executed as expected.
    * Scientific startup script (default PYTHONSTARTUP in Spyder): added floating point division (from __future__ import division)
    * PySide support:
      * Added new "Qt (PyQt/PySide)" settings group in "External modules" tab
      * It is now possible to select the Qt-Python bindings library: default (i.e. depends on the QT_API environment variable), PyQt or PySide
      * The PyQt input hook has been adapted for PySide, so it is now possible to do interactive (non-blocking) plotting with PySide
    * New options for standard Python interpreters (no effect on !IPython):
      * "Merge process standard output/error channels": merging the output channels of the process means that the standard error won't be written in red anymore, but this has the effect of speeding up display
      * "Colorize standard error channel using ANSI escape codes": this method is the only way to have colorized standard error channel when the output channels have been merged
  * Internal console (Issue 868): output is now immediately available
  * "Maximize current plugin" action: now automatically shows the "Outline" plugin when maximizing the "Editor" plugin
  * Editor/Outline comment separators: allow space betwee hash and dash, e.g "# --- Outline Separator"

----

== Version 2.1.4 ==

=== Bug fixes (since v2.1.3) ===

  * Console:
    * *Critical bugfix* for IPython support: variable explorer link was broken (regression introduced with v2.1.3)

=== Other changes (since v2.1.3) ===

  * Console:
    * option "Open an IPython interperter at startup" is now *explicitely* disabled for IPython v0.11+ (these versions of IPython are not fully supported through Spyder's console plugin)

----

== Version 2.1.3 ==

=== Enhancements (since v2.1.2) ===

  * Variable explorer performance were improved, especially when dealing with very long sequences -- See this discussion: http://groups.google.com/group/spyderlib/browse_thread/thread/3a7ef892695e417a
  * Variable explorer / dictionary editor: added support for unknown objects -- this allows browsing any object attributes -- This is still experimental.

=== Bug fixes (since v2.1.2) ===

  * General:
    * Spyder preferences/bugfix: comboboxes with keys other than strings (e.g. the PyQt API selection combo box) were not initialized properly
    * Fixed memory leaks (QThread objects) in the "Editor" and "Find in files" plugins. In those two plugins, QThread objects were created, then started but were never garbage-collected after they finished their execution
  * Editor:
    * Supported file types: added missing C++ file extensions (.cc,
.hh, .hxx)
  * Variable explorer:
    * Debugging: added support for editing objects within functions
    * Debugging: when debugging, variable explorer link was broken after restarting program
    * handling errors when trying to enable/disable autorefresh (if one of the running console has no monitor enabled)
  * Project explorer:
    * when the workspace has not yet been defined, creating a new project not only warns the user but also proposes to set it right away

----

== Version 2.1.2 ==

=== Bug fixes (since v2.1.1) ===

  * General:
    * Patched external path library to avoid a crash with a user HOME directory with non-ascii characters
    * Doc/README: warning the user about the fact that the 'python setup.py install' method does not uninstall a previous version
  * Console:
    * Fixed "!AccessInit: hash collision: 3 for both 1 and 1" error (see Issue 595)
  * Project explorer:
    * empty workspace/critical bugfix: impossible to create/import projects from context menu (this bug was introduced with a recent revision and stayed unnoticed until then because one has to test this from an empty workspace)
    * it is now possible to rename projects (safely)
    * now handling the I/O errors (e.g. read-only configuration files) occuring when loading/saving projects or the workspace: warning the user when an !IOError exception was raised and mention the projects which could not be saved properly
  * File/Project explorer:
    * keyboard shortcut 'F2' (rename file/directory) was broken
    * the "Open" action (context menu) was failing silently for directories (expected behavior: open an external file explorer to browse the directory)
    * programs.start_file/bugfix: feature was not working on Windows 7
  * Editor:
    * Fix empty username in new file template on OS X (patch by Christoph Gohle)
  * Object inspector:
    * Rich text mode was not showing headings when invoked from editor (Issue 690)

=== Enhancements (since v2.1.1) ===

  * File/Project explorer:
    * Added "Delete" keyboard shortcut to remove selected file(s)/folder(s)
    * SCM integration: added support for !TortoiseHg v2 (only v1 was supported)
  * Console/Matplotlib options: the backend may now be set separately from the Matplotlib patch

=== Other changes (since v2.1.1) ===

  * Console:
    * The Matplotlib patch is only applied for Matplotlib <=v1.0
    * !PyQt API version issues (error like "!ValueError: API 'QString' has already been set to version 1"): the "ignore setapi errors" option is disabled by default, to avoid masking these errors and associated tracebacks

----

== Version 2.1.1 ==

_Note:_ v2.1.1 is a minor update of v2.1.0 (licence issues and minor bug fixes -- see the [http://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/source/list?name=v2.1.1 Mercurial changelog]).

=== Compatibility/Requirements ===

Since version 2.1:
  * Spyder is now compatible with:
    * !PyQt's API v1 (i.e. compatible with !PyQt 4.4 and 4.5), the default Python 2 API
    * *and* !PyQt's API v2 (this is the future: default Python 3 API and !PySide-compatible API)
    * *and* with !PySide (!PySide support is still experimental as this library is still young but its stability is evolving rapidly)
  * Editor/code analysis: Spyder now requires *pyflakes v0.5.0* (included in Windows installers).

=== New features since v2.0.12 ===

*New major features*:
  * New *Profiler* plugin (thanks to Santiago Jaramillo)
  * New experimental *IPython* plugin embedding IPython's Qt console: see [http://spyder-ide.blogspot.com/2011/08/preview-of-new-ipython-plugin-for.html here]
  * General:
    * Main window:
      * added "Custom window layouts" management (see menu "View")/handling 3 custom layouts: default shortcuts Shift+Alt+FX to switch to/from layout #X and Ctrl+Shift+Alt+FX to set layout #X
      * "General" preferences page: added option to set the Qt windows style, depending on platform (Plastique, Cleanlooks, CDE, Windows...)
      * Menu "?": added menu entry to report Spyder issues, filling automatically informations on your configuration
      * Reorganized "Run"/"Source" menu, added "Interpreters" menu
      * Fixed application name for Gnome 3/Fedora 15
    * Command line options: added option "--defaults" to reset settings (stored in .spyder.ini) to defaults (a lot of settings are preserved: shortcuts, window layouts, ...) -- this is less brutal than "--reset" which reset all settings by removing all configuration files related to Spyder

  * *Outline* (function/class browser) is now a plugin in itself, embedded in its own dockwidget: Spyder's window layout is even more customizable than before
  * *Code completion*
    * (Editor/Console): entries starting with an underscore character are now placed to the end of the suggested list
    * (Editor/Console): Import statements are now completed correctly
  * *Console*:
    * Major code cleaning: running Python applications in Spyder has never been cleaner and is very close to a simple Python interpreter
    * Added built-in function `open_in_spyder` to open a file in Spyder's source code editor from the console
    * Standard Python interpreter:
      * now refresh the variable explorer at each new prompt (even if auto-refresh is disabled -- actually, this is the typical use case)
      * added support for basic special commands (%pwd, %ls, %clear) and system commands (starting with '!', e.g. !dir or !ls)
      * added [http://spyder-ide.blogspot.com/2011/09/new-enhanced-scientific-python.html "scientific" startup script] with support for numpy, scipy and matplotlib
    * Preferences (External modules tab):
      * added an option to set !PyQt API to v1 or v2 -- this avoids issues with Enthought Tool Suite or any other library/program using !PyQt API v2 which is *not* the default API for Python 2
      * changed matplotlib patch to fix compatiblity issue with !PyQt API v2
    * Preferences (Advanced Settings tab): added option "Python executable" to customize path to Python interpreter executable binary
  * *Variable explorer*:
    * New HDF5 plugin ([http://code.google.com/u/DavidAnthonyPowell/ DavidAnthonyPowell]): import/export HDF5 files to/from the variable explorer
    * Dictionary editor/Variable explorer:
      * Added support for more NumPy data types
      * Added action "Resize rows to contents" (partially implements feature requested with Issue 807)
  * *Editor*:
    * find/replace:
      * added support for *multiline* regular expression search pattern
      * added support for *multiline* regular expression text replacement
      * added button "Highlight matches" to highlight all found results
    * syntax highlighting: added support for OpenCL, gettext files, patch/diff files, CSS and HTML files
    * support for "2 spaces" and "tabs" indentation characters
    * new code analysis feature: added support for the [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8 pep8] style guide checker
    * "Comment" and "Uncomment" actions were replaced by a single "Comment/Uncommment" toggle action
    * (Fixes  Issue 811 ) "Run configuration": added "Run in an external system terminal" option
  * *File explorer* and *Project explorer*:
    * great performance improvement (using a multithreaded file system model)
    * Added minimalist SCM support (Mercurial and git are currently supported)
  * *File explorer*: added an option to "Show current directory only"
  * *Project explorer*: this plugin was entirely rewritten to improve performances and usability
  * *Pylint plugin*:
    * added option to save file before analyzing it

Spyder's console embedded in your application (spyderlib.widgets.internalshell):
  * in traceback, a clickable link now opens the associated file in Spyder (if application was launched from Spyder with monitor enabled)
  * Application sample embedding Spyder's internal shell: upgraded to guidata v1.4+ (simplified build script a lot!)

Windows platforms specific changes:
  * (requires pywin32) Hiding the attached console window:
    * allow running Spyder with 'python.exe' without visible console (this avoid using 'pythonw.exe' which does not attach a console to the process, hence preventing standard I/O to be redirected in a subprocess executed within Spyder, e.g. in your own program)
    * the attached console may be shown/hidden from menu entry "View > Attached console window (debugging)"
  * Major change for Windows/!PyQt users: standard Python interpreter now supports interactive GUI manipulations thanks to a new Spyder-specific input hook (replacing !PyQt's input hook which is not working within Spyder on Windows platforms) -- the input hook works even better than !PyQt's builtin input hook (with a Python interpreter opened outside Spyder)!
  * Spyder's stand-alone version building process was improved. This version is now available on project's download page.

=== Bug fixes (since v2.0.12) ===

*Spyder's main window*:
  * !QtDesigner and !QtLinguist were not detected on Fedora
  * Console/Editor: code completion widget was partially hidden when working on two monitors and if Spyder's window was on the right screen
  * Fixed bugs due to too early/frequent calls to plugin refresh methods during startup

*Console*:
  * IPython Interpreter: Turn off autoindent magic to avoid indentation errors with code with inline comments

*Editor*:
  * Fortran syntax highlighter was made case insensitive
  * Fixed !IndentationError when running first line of a file
  * Read only files allowed ".", "[", "(", etc. to be entered into the text editor
  * Fixed segmentation faults occuring after using the vertical-horizontal splitting feature
  * If a file name had non-ascii characters then code completion
(and all other rope-based features) in the editor stopped working
  * Code analysis: fixed tasks pattern (for example, previous one was matching "TIP" in "MULTIPLICATION"... now it will match only single "TIP:" or "TIP ")
  * (Fixes  Issue 704 ) Outline was showing the delimiters of block comments ('#------...-'), causing nesting inconsistencies because block comments are not indented properly with respect to the code around
  * Fixed several bugs with the "Run selection or current block" feature.

*Object inspector*:
  * Rich text mode was failing for non-ascii docstrings

*Find/Replace widget*:
  * Combo box history was populated only when pressing Enter (now pressing F3 to find next occurence will add the current entry to history)

----

== Version 2.0.9 ==

=== Bug fixes (since v2.0.8) ===

----

== Version 2.0.8 ==

=== Bug fixes (since v2.0.6) ===

  * Consoles/bugfix: saving history log (see context menu) was not working following a recent code cleaning/refactoring
  * On non-Windows platforms, the file selection dialog "All files (*.*)" filter was not matching files without extension
  * dochelpers.isdefined/bugfix: ignoring syntax errors while evaluating object

  * Editor/bugfix: disabling code completion/calltips for non-Python source code (was not working -as expected- but was taking time to simply not work...)
  * Editor/go to line: fixed unicode error
  * Code editor/bugfix: cursor position was not restored when undoing an indent operation with "tab always indent" feature turned on *and* the cursor at the end of the line
  * Tab behavior when "tab always indents" is turned off: inserting 4-(len(leading_text) % 4) spaces (instead of 4)
  * Object inspector/bugfix: ignoring unknown objects when called automatically from editor/console, i.e. do not log, do not show 'no doc available'

=== Other changes (since v2.0.6) ===

  * Code editor syntax highlighting: added more keywords to Cython syntax highlighter (cpdef, inline, cimport and DEF)
  * Added example of application using the Spyder's internal shell as a debugging console (demonstrates also the py2exe deployment procedure)

  * Preferences dialog box/Keyboard shortcuts:
    * conflicts are now ignored if shortcuts have different contexts *except* if one of this context is '`_`' (i.e. global context)
    * conflict warnings are now also shown when showing the preferences dialog box (not only when modifying shortcuts and applying changes)
  * Drag/drop Python script to console: fixed TypeError (TypeError: start() got an unexpected keyword argument 'ask_for_arguments')

  * Editor/80-column vertical edge line: added options to show/hide this line and change the column number
  * Editor: added "Comment"/"Uncomment" actions to context menu
  * Source code and shell editor widgets: code refactoring/cleaning (this should help people using these widgets outside Spyder)
