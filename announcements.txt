===========================

Hi all,

On the behalf of Spyder's development team (http://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/people/list), I'm pleased to announce that Spyder v2.2 has been released and is available for Windows XP/Vista/7/8, GNU/Linux and MacOS X: http://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/.

This release represents 18 months of development since v2.1 and introduces major enhancements and new features:
 * Full support for IPython v0.13, including the ability to attach to existing kernels
 * New MacOS X application
 * Much improved debugging experience
 * Various editor improvements for code completion, zooming, auto insertion, and syntax highlighting
 * Better looking and faster Object Inspector
 * Single instance mode
 * Spanish tranlation of the interface
 * And many other changes: http://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/wiki/ChangeLog

This is the last release to support Python 2.5:
 * Spyder 2.2 supports Python 2.5 to 2.7
 * Spyder 2.3 will support Python 2.7 to 3.3
 * (Spyder 2.1.14dev4 is a development release which already supports Python 3)

Spyder is a free, open-source (MIT license) interactive development environment for the Python language with advanced editing, interactive testing, debugging and introspection features. Originally designed to provide MATLAB-like features (integrated help, interactive console, variable explorer with GUI-based editors for dictionaries, NumPy arrays, ...), it is strongly oriented towards scientific computing and software development. Thanks to the `spyderlib` library, Spyder also provides powerful ready-to-use widgets: embedded Python console (example: http://packages.python.org/guiqwt/_images/sift3.png), NumPy array editor (example: http://packages.python.org/guiqwt/_images/sift2.png), dictionary editor, source code editor, etc.
