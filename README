    Overview

        Spyder is a Python development environment with tons of features:
            Editor
                Multi-language editor with function/class browser, code analysis
                (pyflakes and pylint are currently supported), horizontal/verti-
                cal splitting, etc.
            Documentation viewer
                Automatically show documentation (if available, or source code
                otherwise) for any class instantiation or function call made
                in a Python shell (interactive/external console, see below)
            Interactive console
                Python shell with workspace support (variable explorer with GUI
                based editors: dictionary editor, array editor, ...) and
                matplotlib figures integration
            External console (separate process)
                Run Python scripts (interactive, debugging or normal mode) or
                open a Python interpreter with variable explorer and documenta-
                tion viewer support (a basic terminal window may also be opened
                with the external console)
            File/directories explorer
            Find in files feature
                Supporting regular expressions and mercurial repositories
            History log

        Spyder may also be used as a PyQt4 extension library (module 'spyderlib').
        For example, the Python interactive shell widget used in Spyder may be
        embedded in your own PyQt4 application.

    Build dependencies

        When installing Spyder from the .zip source package (using the 
        command `python setup.py install`), the requirements are:
            Python 2.5+
            sphinx 0.6+ (documentation generation)

    Runtime dependencies
    
        Python 2.5+
        PyQt4 4.4+
            
        Recommended modules
            pyflakes >v0.3.0 (real-time code analysis)
            rope >=v0.9.2 (editor code completion, calltips and go-to-definition)
            sphinx >= v0.6 (object inspector's rich text mode)
            numpy (N-dimensional arrays)
            scipy (signal/image processing)
            matplotlib (2D/3D plotting)
            IPython (enhanced Python interpreter)
	    
        Optional modules
            pylint (powerful code analysis)

    Running from source
      
        It is possible to run Spyder directly from unpacked source folder.
        Especially useful for troubleshooting and development of Spyder itself.
            `python bootstrap.py`

    Installation
    
        From the source package (see section 'Building dependencies'):
            `python setup.py install`
