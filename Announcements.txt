Minor release to list
=====================

Subject: [ANN] Spyder 3.1 is released!


Hi all,

On the behalf of the Spyder Project Contributors (https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/graphs/contributors),
I'm pleased to announce that Spyder 3.1 has been released and is available for
Windows, GNU/Linux and MacOS X: https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/releases

This release comes two months after version 3.0.2 and introduces several new features
and enhancements:

**Main Window**
* Add an introduction interactive tour to explain the main Spyder
  components (in `Help > Interactive tours`). This tour was
  announced in Spyder 3.0 but deactivated due to an error.

**Editor**
* Add the Solarized Light and Dark color schemes.
* Add support for greedy regular expressions in the find/replace widget
  (only available with PyQt5).
* Improve the use of tabs instead of spaces for indentation.
* Add `Ctrl+Shift+T` shortcut to reopen the last closed file.
* Show completions for Numpy and Matplotlib compiled objects (e.g.
  `np.array` and `plt.figure`)
* Disambiguate tabs in case users open several files with the same
  name.
* Add the shortcut `Ctrl+Alt+P` to open a switcher to select among
  the symbols (functions, methods or classes) present in a file.
  Also add an entry in the `File` menu and toolbar button to show
  this switcher. 

**Variable Explorer**
* Add support for the most important numeric types of Numpy (32 and 64
  bits int, float and complex numbers).
* Save format for floats in DataFrame editor.
* Make the index column of DataFrame editor always visible when scrolling
  to right and left.
* Add support for Pandas DatetimeIndex objects.
* Show empty Numpy arrays.

**IPython Console**
* Be able to load kernel json files anywhere in the file system when
  connecting to external kernels.
* Add an option (under `Preferences > Run` and `Run > Configure`) to
  clear all variables present in a console before running a file (it
  runs `%reset -f` in the associated kernel).

**Profiler**
* Show time units (in seconds) spent by each function or method.

**Settings**
* Make all keyboard shortcuts configurable

**Under the hood**
* Add the `--project <path-to-dir>` command line option to load
  projects at startup.
* Add the chardet and numpydoc libraries as new dependencies.

In this release we also fixed 79 issues and merged 91 pull requests that amount
to more than 500 commits. For a full list of fixes, please see our changelog:

Last, but not least, we welcome any contribution that helps making Spyder an
efficient scientific development and computing environment. Join us to help

Major release to list
=====================

Subject: [ANN] Spyder 3.0 is released!


Hi all,

On the behalf of the Spyder Project Contributors (https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/graphs/contributors),
I'm pleased to announce that Spyder 3.0 has been released and is available for
Windows, GNU/Linux and MacOS X: https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/releases

This release represents more than two years of development since version 2.3.0 was
released, and it introduces major enhancements and new features. The most important ones
are:

* Third-party plugins: External developers can now create plugins that extend Spyder in
  novel and interesting ways. For example, we already have plugins for the line-profiler
  and memory-profiler projects, and also a graphical frontend for the conda package
  manager. These plugins can be distributed as pip and/or conda packages for authors
  convenience.
* Improved projects support: Projects have been revamped and improved significantly in
  Spyder 3.0. With our new projects support, people will have the possibility of easily
  working on different coding efforts at the same time. That's because projects save the
  state of open files in the Editor and allow Python packages created as part of the
  project to be imported in our consoles.
* Support for much more programming languages: Spyder relies now on the excellent Pygments
  library to provide syntax highlight and suggest code completions in the Editor, for all
  programming languages supported by it.
* A new file switcher: Spyder 3.0 comes with a fancy file switcher, very similar in
  spirit to the one present in Sublime Text. This is a dialog to select among the open
  files in the Editor, by doing a fuzzy search through their names. It also lets users to
  view the list of classes, methods and functions defined in the current file, and select
  one of them. This dialog is activated with `Ctrl+P`.
* A Numpy array graphical builder: Users who need to create NumPy arrays in Spyder for
  matrices and vectors can do it now in a graphical way by pressing `Ctrl+M` in the Editor
  or the Consoles. This will open an empty 2D table widget to be filled with the data
  required by the user.
* A new icon theme based on FontAwesome.
* A new set of default pane layouts for those coming from Rstudio or Matlab (under
  `View > Window layouts`).
* A simpler and more intuitive way to introduce keyboard shortcuts.
* Support for PyQt5, which fixes problems in MacOS X and in high definition screens.

Spyder 2.3 has been a huge success (being downloaded almost 550,000 times!) and
we hope 3.0 will be as successful as it. For that we fixed 203 important bugs,
merged 218 pull requests from about 40 authors and added almost 2850 commits
between these two releases.

Last, but not least, we welcome any contribution that helps making Spyder an

your favorite environment!

Major release to others
=======================

Subject: [ANN] Spyder 3.0 is released!


Hi all,

On the behalf of the Spyder Project Contributors (https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/graphs/contributors),
I'm pleased to announce that Spyder 3.0 has been released and is available for
Windows, GNU/Linux and MacOS X: https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/releases

Spyder is a free, open-source (MIT license) interactive development environment
for the Python language with advanced editing, interactive testing, debugging
and introspection features. It was designed to provide MATLAB-like features
(integrated help, interactive console, variable explorer with GUI-based editors
for NumPy arrays and Pandas dataframes), it is strongly oriented towards
scientific computing and software development.

<The rest is the same as for the list>

Beta release
============

Subject: [ANN] Spyder 3.0 seventh public beta release


Hi all,

On the behalf of the Spyder Project Contributors (https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/graphs/contributors),
I'm pleased to announce the seventh beta of our next major version: Spyder 3.0.

We've been working on this version for more than two years now and as far as we know
it's working very well. There are still several bugs to squash but we encourage all
people who like the bleeding edge to give it a try. This beta version is released
two weeks after our sixth one and it includes more than 200 commits.

Spyder 3.0 comes with several interesting and exciting new features. The most
important ones are:

* Third-party plugins: External developers can now create plugins that extend Spyder in
  novel and interesting ways. For example, we already have plugins for the line-profiler
