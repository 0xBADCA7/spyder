Installation
============

Dependencies
------------

Requirements:
    * Python 2.x (x>=5)
    * PyQt4 >= v4.4
            
Recommended modules:
    * rope >= v0.9.2 (editor code completion, calltips and go-to-definition)
    * sphinx >= v0.6 (object inspector's rich text mode)
    * numpy (N-dimensional arrays)
    * scipy (signal/image processing)
    * matplotlib (2D/3D plotting)
    * IPython (enhanced Python interpreter)
	
Optional modules:
    * pylint (code analysis)

.. note::

    Since v2.1, the `pyflakes` tool (real-time Python code analysis) has been
    integrated to Spyder for performance and thread-safe reasons. As a
    consequence, it is no longer necessary to install `pyflakes` separately.


Installation
------------

From the source package:
    `python setup.py install`
